/*
 * interp_bridge — the interp816 <-> AOT bridge (interpreter-fallback tier).
 *
 * Entered at a trap site (Phase 1b: dispatch_oob / bank-miss; the spike uses
 * a synthetic site) with a known guest PC and the live CpuState. Runs the
 * LakeSnes-derived interpreter (interp816) over guest code, SHARING the
 * caller's register state and memory:
 *   - memory goes through the AOT cpu_read8 / cpu_write8 HLE bus (one map);
 *   - register/flag state is synced CpuState <-> Interp816 at every crossing.
 *
 * When the interpreted code calls (JSR/JSL) into a guest address that has a
 * compiled body (a g_dispatch_table entry for the current (m,x)), the call is
 * BOUNCED through cpu_dispatch_pc so compiled code keeps running compiled;
 * the interpreter resumes at the return address. Honors the Option-1 cpu->S
 * return-frame model (see cpu_state.h / docs/MULTI_TIER.md).
 *
 * The bridge exits when the interpreted routine returns past its entry stack
 * depth (an RTS/RTL that leaves cpu->S above the value at entry). The caller
 * must have a return frame (or sentinel) on cpu->S so that final RTS has
 * something to pop — exactly as the Option-1 model already arranges for
 * dispatched entries.
 *
 * Anti-RECURSION_BUG contract (docs/MULTI_TIER.md §6): re-entry is bounded by
 * guest call depth (bounces RETURN, never stack a permanent interp context),
 * exit asserts a balanced stack, and there is no host recursion unmatched by
 * a guest return.
