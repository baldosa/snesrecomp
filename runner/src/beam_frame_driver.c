/* Beam-aligned frame driver. See beam_frame_driver.h.
 *
 * Brought up on Doom (SuperFX 2), whose frame is a raster IRQ chain: a split
 * at line 23 ends the top forced-blank border, one at line 199 starts the
 * bottom one and DMAs the GSU's frame to VRAM through vblank, and each GSU
 * STOP raises an IRQ that starts the next GSU task. Measured against Mesen2
 * (tools/mesen_scene, irq_log=1): 2-4 IRQs per field at those lines. Each
 * rule below is a way the scaffold's earlier driver broke that chain. */
